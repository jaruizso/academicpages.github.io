Scholars have researched the emergence of a European public sphere (EPS) where citizens of Europe are able to participate in transnational conversations. Some scholars argue that it is not possible to have an EPS, because of national media, languages and socio-cultural barriers. For others, there are different overlapping EPSs at the same time (local, regional, and European) or an Europeanisation of national public spheres.
The argument of my PhD project is that the Internet seems to hold much potential in contributing to the emerging of an EPS given that it is comprised of many citizens writing their personal opinions on EU matters, usually in different languages and in different online platforms. From a participatory perspective, it might help in the democratisation of European discussions, as the international audiences now can avoid the political and cultural filters of the national media when engaging in online debates. The Internet, owing to its characteristics (cheap, global and two-way communication) can be seen as one of the several possibilities contributing to the development of a –real and horizontal– European public sphere.
