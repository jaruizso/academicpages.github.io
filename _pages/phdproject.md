## Twitter as the new Coffe house? The mapping of the European Political Twittersphere and its significance for the European Public Sphere

### Theoretical Framework

Scholars have researched the emergence of a European public sphere (EPS) where citizens of Europe are able to participate in transnational conversations. Some scholars argue that it is not possible to have an EPS, because of national media, languages and socio-cultural barriers. For others, there are different overlapping EPSs at the same time (local, regional, and European) or an Europeanisation of national public spheres.
The argument of my PhD project is that the Internet seems to hold much potential in contributing to the emerging of an EPS given that it is comprised of many citizens writing their personal opinions on EU matters, usually in different languages and in different online platforms. From a participatory perspective, it might help in the democratisation of European discussions, as the international audiences now can avoid the political and cultural filters of the national media when engaging in online debates. The Internet, owing to its characteristics (cheap, global and two-way communication) can be seen as one of the several possibilities contributing to the development of a –real and horizontal– European public sphere.


The Ph.D. project is divided in three academic papers. Each one of them with different angle but using the same data. I use a computational social science approach....



### Data

Data from March 2016 to today collected by the [Twitter Capture Analysis](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/dmi-tcat/wiki) from Amsterdam University installed in an Amazon EC2 Server.

### Paper 1: a Networked Public Sphere study

This article is an explorative approach to Twitter networks of European topics, named as European Political Twittersphere. Since there is a lack of extensive empirical research in how these European networks are organized, either what qualities or characteristics they have, it is important as a first step, to explore and understand these networks for further analysis. The purpose of this article is to discern the main characteristics of these networks by using Social Network Analysis and the theoretical framework of Networked Public Sphere.
The outcomes of this paper are important to understand how a platform such Twitter contributes to a transnational dialogue about relevant European topics inside a European Public Sphere. In addition the paper shows empirical evidence of the normative concept of Networked Public Spheres by Benkler, where individual users play an important role filtering and transmitting information. A role that until now was dominated by big news corporations and political institutions.

### Paper 2: a transnational European Public Sphere

The article explores in-depth, from a bottom-up approach, the interactions formed around Twitter issue publics of European relevance, with their geographic location. To respond the research questions I apply network analysis. The geolocation of the tweets have been collected. For this purpose I used geocoding strategies for Twitter place field of the users, making use of the Google Geocoding API.
The results show that there is certain degree of transnational European Public Sphere in these topics. However they are still small compared to discussion about the topics made nationally.

### Paper 3: a content and sentiment analysis of European topics

The third article looks at the content of the networks. Once we have the characteristics of the noetworks, and once we know what kind of -transnational- interactions users have, its time to look how and what users talk about the topics mapped. The thirs article is a content & sentiment analyis.
